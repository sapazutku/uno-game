Rules of Simplified Uno

A Simplified Uno deck comes with 72 cards: Yellow, Red, Green and Blue are the four colors of cards and there are two copies of each number 1 through 9, for each color.

There are two players in the game.

The deck is shuffled and then each player is dealt 7 cards. The first player gets to discard any card they like into the discard pile. From that point on, the players alternate turns.

From this point on, a playable card is simply one that is either the same color or number as the top card (last card discarded) of the discard stack.

If the player has a “playable” card in his/her hand, then they are asked which card to play. If they choose one of the playable cards, it is removed from their hand and added to the top of the discard pile. If they choose an unplayable card and have a playable card, ask again until they choose a playable card. Otherwise, if they cannot play a card, they draw one card from the deck, and their turn is over.

The game continues until either player has discarded all of his/her cards or the initial deck is emptied. If a player gets rid of all their cards, they win at that point in time. If the initial deck is exhausted, the game finishes in a tie.
